# @api3/airnode-deployer

The airnode-deployer package is used primarily by the Docker Images. This CLI tool provides the underlying commands used
by the Docker images when deploying an Airnode.

> API providers are strongly encouraged to use the Docker images when deploying an Airnode and not the deployer CLI
> commands directly.

## Documentation

Use the [Docker Images](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/latest/grp-providers/docker/) to deploy an Airnode.

Try the [Quick Deploy Tutorials](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/latest/grp-providers/tutorial/) to learn more about how
an Airnode is deployed using the Docker images.

See the [Deployer Package](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/latest/reference/packages/deployer.html) documentation to build
and use the deployer CLI. Remember, the best way to deploy an Airnode is with the Docker images.
